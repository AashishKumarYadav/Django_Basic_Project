# Django_Basic_Project
These are some of the steps I had to implement in this project.
step 1. create a new HTML page nameed "task.html"
step 2. create a basic CSS file named "style.css"
Step 3. We need a new url 'localhost:8000/url/task'
step 4. we need a view which will respond with Task.html
step 5. we need dynamic data on our html page
