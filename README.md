# Django_Basic_Project<br/>
These are some of the steps I had to implement in this project. <br/>
step 1. create a new HTML page nameed "task.html"<br/>
step 2. create a basic CSS file named "style.css"<br/>
Step 3. We need a new url 'localhost:8000/url/task'<br/>
step 4. we need a view which will respond with Task.html<br/>
step 5. we need dynamic data on our html page<br/>
